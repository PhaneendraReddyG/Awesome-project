This year has been a period of significant professional growth, driven by challenging projects and the opportunity to expand my DevOps skillset within Pearson's CI/CD framework. I am especially grateful for the support and guidance of Biju Radhakrishnan and RaviShankar Bonu. Moving forward, I am committed to acting on my manager's feedback by documenting my experiences and contributing to practice knowledge sharing, while also seeking opportunities to improve existing processes.
